CzechStemmer.jar -m expandall 
                 -d <dict-file> 
                 -a <affix-file> 
                 [-p <depth>] 
                 [-e <exceptions>]
                 [-l] 

Loads a dictionary from dict-file and affix-file and expands all words 
in the dictionary according to the expansion rules in the affix file. 
As there may be chained/recursive rules in the affix file, expansion is done 
up to some depth that can be set by -p option (default depth is 5).

   -d <dict>   base terms dictionary used for expansion; only words contained
               in the dictionary can be expanded
   -a <affix-file> file with expansion rules
   -p <depth>  expansion depth limit (default 5)
   -e <exceptions> set file with lemma:form pairs that should be excluded
                   from the result
   -l          convert dictionary, affix rules and the input to lower case 
               (use when you require case-insensitive operation)
