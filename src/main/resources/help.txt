Usage:
  CzechStemmer.jar -m <processing-mode> [mode-specific-options]

Available processing modes:
  stem - read words from stdin and print reduced forms (stems/lemmata) to stdout
  expand - read basic word forms from stdin and print their expanded forms to stdout
  expandall - similar to expand but the words are taken from the dictionary file itself;
  wordlist - expand words from dictionary with sticky rules and print them
  fstbuild - create a FST file (a string->string dictionary optimized for memory consumption)
  fstcheck - search in a FST dictionary created in fstbuild mode
  fstsearch - same as fstcheck

For help on the particular mode, use 
  CzechStemmer.jar -m <mode> -h
