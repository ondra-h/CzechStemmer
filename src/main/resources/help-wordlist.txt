  
Usage:
  CzechStemmer.jar -m wordlist -d <dict-file> -a <affix-file> [-p <depth>] [-l] 

Loads a dictionary from dict-file and affix-file and expands all words 
in the dictionary according to the sticky expansion rules in the affix file. 
Unlike expandall mode, only sticky rules are used.
As there may be chained/recursive rules in the affix file, expansion is done 
up to some depth that can be set by -p option (default depth is 5).

   -d <dict>   base terms dictionary used for expansion; only words contained
               in the dictionary can be expanded
   -a <affix-file> file with expansion rules
   -p <depth>  expansion depth limit (default 5)
   -l          convert dictionary, affix rules and the input to lower case 
               (use when you require case-insensitive operation)
