Usage:

CzechStemmer.jar -m expand
                 -d <dict-file>
                 -a <affix-file>
                 [-p <depth>]
                 [-e <exceptions>]
                 [-l]

Loads a dictionary from dict-file and affix-file and expands words read 
from stdin using the dictionary and expansion rules. As there may be 
chained/recursive rules in the dictionary, expansion is done up to some depth 
that can be set by -p option (default depth is 5).
The input word list must be in format 1 line = one word.

   -d <dict>   base terms dictionary used for expansion; only words contained
               in the dictionary can be expanded
   -a <affix-file> file with expansion rules
   -p <depth>  expansion depth limit (default 5)
   -e <exceptions> set file with lemma:form pairs that should be excluded
                   from the result
   -l          convert dictionary, affix rules and the input to lower case 
               (use when you require case-insensitive operation)
